This Unity project, title TBD, is an on-rails shooter akin to `StarFox` and `Panzer Dragoon`.

I plan to use `claude.code` to assist in my development efforts - both to accelerate development and to sharpen my prompting skills!

Please feel free to raise a GitHub issue with ideas or thoughts on the prototype! Especially as it pertains to game optimization.

Project currently uses Unity version `6000.3.2f1`
